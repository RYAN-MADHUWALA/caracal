Add materialized views and indexes for ledger query optimization

Revision ID: e4f5g6h7i8j9
Revises: d3e4f5g6h7i8
Create Date: 2026-02-03 10:00:00.000000

Creates materialized views and indexes for optimized ledger queries:
- spending_by_agent_mv: Aggregated spending per agent
- spending_by_time_window_mv: Aggregated spending by time windows
- Composite indexes on ledger_events for common query patterns
- Indexes on resource_type and provisional_charge_id
